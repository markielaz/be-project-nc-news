# Northcoders News API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

If you wish to clone this project and run it locally, you will need to create 2 new environment variables:

.env.test - which will require PGDATABASE=nc_news_test

.env.development - which will rewuire PGDATABASE=nc_news
